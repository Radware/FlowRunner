# priority 1.

 - when trying to add a variable in loop in source field using the add variable button i get this error - Cannot insert variable: Target input is null or undefined.
insertVariableIntoInput @ dialogs.js:234
(anonymous) @ dialogs.js:86 

 - require the option to properly extract body of a  response, for example if the response is a json array i need to extract all of it to one variable, currently if i write body it seems to paste all of responses of all the requests from the flow or at least the same response many times because even though the response was rather small the extracted response was huge.

 - i have noticed that if i delete a step and the step editor is currently empty i cannot save because i get an error that i have unsaved changes in the step, it only works if i click on another step and dismiss the warning and then save.

# priority 2

- add option for random string and or random int.
- overhall logic of recent files to be more like workspace with files opened being improted in (and that could be exported out) with folders.
