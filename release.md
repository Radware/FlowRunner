*   Improved memory management during long-running flows
*   Better handling of concurrent operations

### **Testing & Quality Assurance**
*   Expanded end-to-end test coverage for visual editor interactions

## Installation Assets

Download the appropriate installer for your operating system:

*   **Windows (x64):** `FlowRunnerSetup-x64-win-1.1.1.zip` (Contains `Setup.exe`)
*   **macOS (Apple Silicon / arm64):** `FlowRunnerSetup-arm64-mac-1.1.1.dmg`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Installation Notes & Troubleshooting

These builds remain unsigned. Please follow the same installation procedures as previous versions:

### **Windows Installation:**
1. Download and extract `FlowRunnerSetup-x64-win-1.1.1.zip`
2. Run `Setup.exe` 
3. If Windows SmartScreen appears, click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"
4. The installer runs silently and launches the app automatically

### **macOS Installation:**
1. Download `FlowRunnerSetup-arm64-mac-1.1.1.dmg`
2. Open the DMG and drag FlowRunner to Applications
3. If you see "FlowRunner is damaged" error, run in Terminal:
   ```bash
   xattr -c /Applications/FlowRunner.app
   ```
4. Right-click the app and select "Open" if needed

## üí° New Features Usage Tips

- **Minimap:** Most useful for flows with 10+ steps. Toggle with the `M` key in Node-Graph view
- **Zoom:** Hold `Ctrl/Cmd` while using mouse wheel for quick zoom adjustments
- **Variable Types:** Use JSON type for arrays and objects that you want to loop over or extract from
- **Search Results:** Use the search box in the Runner Panel to quickly find specific step results

## üîÑ Upgrade Notes

Flows created in v1.1.0 are fully compatible with v1.1.1. The new variable typing system is optional - existing flows will continue to work exactly as before, with all variables treated as strings unless you explicitly change their types.

## üöÄ What's Next?

We're continuing to enhance FlowRunner based on your feedback. Upcoming features being considered include:

- Enhanced JSON path picker for easier extraction setup
- Environment variable management
- Additional request body formats
- "Step Into" execution mode for debugging complex conditions and loops
